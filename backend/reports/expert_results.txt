  🧠 Testing Cross-Domain First Principle Extraction
============================================================

[PHYSICS] Evaluating...
Problem: Calculate the escape velocity of a projectile launched from a planet with mass M and radius R, facto...
💎 Extracted Axiom: Always formulate the total energy state equation before attempting kinematic isolation.
🔬 Root Insight: Energy conservation principles bridge conservative fields with non-conservative work terms.

[MATHEMATICS] Evaluating...
Problem: Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using a topological approach....
💎 Extracted Axiom: Map discrete arithmetic progression logic onto topological spaces to prove infinitude.
🔬 Root Insight: Topological compactness connects discrete number properties with continuous spatial concepts.

[LOGIC BUILDING] Evaluating...
Problem: Solve the Byzantine Generals Problem in an asynchronous network without cryptography....
💎 Extracted Axiom: Enforce partial network synchrony assumptions when designing robust distributed consensus protocols.
🔬 Root Insight: Asynchronous consensus is mathematically bounded by the impossibility of deterministic failure detection.

[CODING] Evaluating...
Problem: Optimize a Python function that finds the longest palindromic substring in a string of length N....
💎 Extracted Axiom: Store mirrored right-bound lengths in an array to prevent redundant palindrome center expansions.
🔬 Root Insight: Mirrored subproblem state logic linearly collapses quadratic boundary expansions.
